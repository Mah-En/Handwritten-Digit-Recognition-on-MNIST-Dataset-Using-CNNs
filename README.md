# MNIST CNN Classification Report

This repository contains a LaTeX-based report on handwritten digit recognition using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on the MNIST dataset.

## Contents

- `mnist_report.tex`: The LaTeX source code for the report.
- `output.png`: Loss plot over training epochs.
- `output2.png`: Sample MNIST digits with ground truth labels.
- `README.md`: This markdown file with project description and instructions.

## Project Summary

The project demonstrates how a simple CNN can effectively classify digits from the MNIST dataset. The workflow includes:

- Data preprocessing and normalization
- CNN architecture with convolutional and dense layers
- Training with categorical cross-entropy loss
- Visualization of training loss and sample inputs

## How to Compile

To compile the LaTeX report:

```bash
pdflatex mnist_report.tex
```

Make sure all files (`mnist_report.tex`, `output.png`, `output2.png`) are in the same directory.

## Requirements

You will need a LaTeX distribution such as:

- [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/)
- [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/)
